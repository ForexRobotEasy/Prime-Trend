# Prime Trend Forex

Prime Trend Forex is a forex trading software developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. This program uses a trend detection algorithm based on moving averages to generate entry and exit signals in the forex market. It also includes a noise filter to enhance signal accuracy and a function to calculate statistics on entry points.

## How it Works

The main entry point of the program is the `OnTick()` function. It starts by filtering the market noise using the `FilterNoise()` function, which compares the current price with the previous price and returns the current price if the price change exceeds a predefined threshold. The filtered price is then used for further analysis.

Next, the `GenerateSignals()` function is called to detect trends using the moving averages method. It takes a moving average period as a parameter and calculates the moving average value for the current and previous bar. If the current moving average value is higher than the previous one, it indicates an uptrend. If it is lower, it indicates a downtrend. The strength of the trend is determined by the difference between the current and previous moving average values.

Based on the detected trend direction and strength, the program generates buy or sell signals. If the trend direction is positive (indicating an uptrend) and the trend strength is greater than a predefined threshold, a buy signal is generated. If the trend direction is negative (indicating a downtrend) and the trend strength is greater than the threshold, a sell signal is generated. If neither condition is met, no signal is generated.

After generating the signals, the program calls the `CalculateEntryStatistics()` function to calculate statistics on the entry points. It counts the total number of orders and separates them into buy and sell orders. The statistics can then be outputted for further analysis or trading strategy evaluation.
